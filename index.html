        <h2 id="pho">Pho</h2>

        <h3>What is Pho?</h3>
        <p>Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup base on beef marrow bone broth flavoring and spices with thinly slice beef and meatballs. </p>




        <h3>How do I eat my pho?</h3>
        <p>I like to eat spicy so I will usually add chilli garlic oil paste and sriracha sauce into my pho bowl. Other condiments I use is cilantro, culantro, basil, hoisin sauce, and lime wedges.Hoisin sauce will add just a sweetness into my pho so that my pho bowl will still have a nice balance.</p>


        <h3>Why Pho?</h3>
        <p>The smell of the broth is just so fresh which feels warm and relaxing. Pho sets the mood in a positively way such as a sunny day. A bowl of pho will actually fill my stomache up. Eating pho at restaurants is affordable, but even better when it is home-made because I can add more spices into the pho broth and eat as much as I want. </p>

        <h4 id="watermelon">Watermelon</h4>

        <div class="watermelon"></div>

        <h5>Why I like watermelon?</h5>
        <p>The taste is so refreshing. It is sweet and juicy when taking the first bite into the watermelon. Having it on a sunny day at an outdoor event is common to have watermelon serve there, but for me I have it anywhere as long as the seasons approves it. </p>
